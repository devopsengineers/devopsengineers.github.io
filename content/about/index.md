We are an international collective of engineers deeply involved in DevOps discussions, focusing on subjects such as infrastructure, automation, and continuous integration. Our goal is to further develop and refine Site Reliability and Platform Engineering practices. We are committed to supporting our peers, recognizing their achievements, educating them, and fostering a sense of community. Moreover, we aim to contribute to the public by offering education, collaboration, and advocacy in these specific areas of engineering.

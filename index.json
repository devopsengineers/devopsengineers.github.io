Show Your Effort: Let us know what you\u0026rsquo;ve tried already. This helps us understand where you\u0026rsquo;re stuck and prevents redundant advice. Provide Code Snippets: If applicable, share relevant code or configurations. Format it using code blocks for clarity. For large blocks of text, use !snippets. Context Matters: Explain the goal you\u0026rsquo;re trying to achieve, not just the issue you\u0026rsquo;re facing. This helps us suggest more appropriate solutions. Search First: Before asking, try searching out the problem on Google or in the project\u0026rsquo;s documentation and issue tracker. Your question may have already been answered! Respect Others\u0026rsquo; Time: Be patient and respectful when waiting for responses. Quality assistance may take some time. Engage Actively: If someone provides a solution or asks for clarification, be responsive and grateful. Keep Conversations Public: Avoid sending direct messages (DMs) for support. Keeping discussions public helps others learn and benefits the entire community.

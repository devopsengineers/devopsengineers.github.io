Stories are more effective when they\u0026rsquo;re relatable to wider groups of people, which can be difficult when they\u0026rsquo;re written with lots of jargon. Tech resumes, on average, tend to be jargon-heavy, which inhibits understanding and relatability. If the resume is written with ZERO jargon, it can get passed over by the various keyword-scanning and AI-filtering steps in the modern hiring pipeline. Let\u0026rsquo;s look at some rarely-used ways to refactor that resume into a tool that connects with people, but also makes it past the benevolent AI silently judging your career accomplishments.\nHere are some examples representative of very common anti-patterns in the hundreds of tech resumes we\u0026rsquo;ve helped improve over the years:\nCore Competencies OpenShift, Buildah, Jenkins, Nexus, JFrog Artifactory, eBPF, Cilium, Kubernetes(CNI/CSI/ CRI), OpenStack(Nova[KVM/QEMU/ESXI]/Neutron[Contrail/ Bridging/OVS/N100V/ MidoNet/OpenDaylight(ODL)]/Cinder[iSCSI/SAN/FCoE]/ Glance/Swift/Manilla/ Murano/Sahara[CDH/Spark/Storm/MapR/Cloudera]/ Horizon/Keystone/Kolla/Barbican/ Magnum[K8S/Swarm/Marathon/Mesos]/Ironic, Ceph[CRUSH], Docker/Kolla, Fuel, ReST, SOAP/AXL, Cisco UCS/SAN, Apache Mesos, Cisco Data/ VoIP (IOS/HSRP/BGP/OSPF/ EIGRP/IPTables/Zebra)/(UCCE:ICM/ CVP/IPIVR/CUPS,CUCM/CUC/CUSP/Asterisk) design/deploy/administrate, Virtualbox/Xen/VMWare/GNS3, Postgres/MySQL/InfluxDB/ HBASE/Couchbase/MongoDB database de- sign/administration, linux/unix/windows system administration/ pentest g(PXE/NFS/LAMP/NGINX/SNMP/RRD/SVN/GIT/BZR/ HG/I[D/P]S/Trac), coding in: SQL, C, Java, PHP, Python, Bash, TCL, Perl, MATLAB, OSS cryptography, Gentoo, CentOS, Ubuntu, Debian, CoreOS, Alpine Linux, and LFS, project management including staffing and critical path time/resource management, and (IPT/ DATA) center deployments Infra Devops Engineer, YetAnotherCorp, 01/2013 - present YetAnotherCorp proactively coordinates cooperative niche markets to efficiently maximize next-generation growth strategies. * Built a message queue and processor to break out from the main web application. * Deployed Datadog into EC2 and RDS for observability and monitoring of prod issues. * Deployed an open-source tool to allow a small group of vetted users to query active production databases. * Wrote a Lambda to alert on IAM permission change events in Slack. * Assisted in making a prod-grade Kubernetes cluster from the ground up for corporate services. Installed Datadog and Threat Stack for monitoring. * Developed CI CD pipeline for EMR Clusters via Linux Bash, Python, Lambda, and CloudFormation Software Engineer, SomeOtherCorp, 10/2009 - 01/2013 * Full-stack Django dev writing front and backend features. * Worked with project management to turn business needs into software. * Provisioned \u0026amp; deploy AWS services such as SageMaker, Glue, EMR, Lambda, SQS, SNS, S3, EC2, \u0026amp; ElasticSearch into 2 production accounts Sys Admin and Network Engineer, SomeCorp, 01/2007 - 09/2009 * Managed a small team and a 200-server environment with CDN across a dozen colocation facilities. This helped athletic department webpages, served video-on-demand, and online television. * Also responsible for L1 Service Provider PCI DSS compliance. Consider the AI/Automated Scanning Tech # First thing, if your resume has fancy colors and icons and typography, get rid of them. They are a relic of the before-times when resumes were printed out as-received and \u0026lsquo;standing out\u0026rsquo; was a possibility. In this age of Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) and AI relevancy-filtering, machines are going to have first \u0026rsquo;eyes\u0026rsquo; on your resume 100% of the time. You don\u0026rsquo;t want a bug in the ingestion software to keep you from a potential new gig, so make it easy for the all-benevolent, all-seeing AI to parse, standardize, and format your resume. The general rule is, if you can convert the resume to plain, boring, unformatted text and STILL have it maintain a good visual flow - sections delineated by judicious use of whitespace, etc - you\u0026rsquo;re on the right track. When you do go back to rich text, the fanciest you should go is to add underlines, italics, bold, etc.\nAs far as making it past the keyword-scanning bots, the \u0026lsquo;Core Competencies\u0026rsquo; section is great for this. It can safely be moved to the bottom, as humans will never read that far, but a keyword-scanner will definitely hit on anything it contains. This lets you get rid of bullet-points like the following:\n* Provisioned \u0026amp; deploy AWS services such as SageMaker, Glue, EMR, Lambda, SQS, SNS, S3, EC2, \u0026amp; ElasticSearch into 2 production accounts\nand cram all that buzzword-goodness into your Core Competencies section.\nFormatting for Experience # A good format to consider is:\n2-4 sentences about the company, anything special about their stack, and the overall \u0026#34;how these people are better for my involvement there\u0026#34; summary, and then: - bullet-points - go - here - each with \u0026#39;a number\u0026#39; attached - no number? - no bullet-point - and as many as - needed to get - the point - across Here is the critical point: you want every bullet-point in your resume to reference a number of some kind: either \u0026lsquo;dollars earned\u0026rsquo;, or \u0026rsquo;time saved\u0026rsquo;.\nFor example:\n* Developed CI/CD pipeline for EMR Clusters via Linux Bash, Python, Lambda, and CloudFormation\nThis, as-written, is \u0026lsquo;resume parsley\u0026rsquo;. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t DO anything, it takes up space, and all those keywords are better off being in the \u0026lsquo;core competencies\u0026rsquo; section as there are no numbers attached to anything. A first-stab rewrite might look like:\n* Developed and deployed an EMR-focused CI/CD pipeline so the Data Science team didn't have to spend 20 hrs/wk manually ingesting terabytes of JSON into our data-lake\nContrast that example with:\n* Designed an automation framework via Lambda \u0026amp; Python APIs for AWS Glue, resulting in $11.5k annual savings\nThis is excellent! It briefly mentions \u0026rsquo;the thing you worked with\u0026rsquo;, and then puts a nice five-figure dollar number right at the end. This is crucial for making that human connection.\nConsider The Human # Once the AI has had its way with your resume and it is delivered to an Actual Human™, that human is not going to be particularly technical. Put yourself in their shoes for a minute: This person will be going cross-eyed, staring at dozens of resumes full of unfamiliar tech-jargon, with no real way to relate \u0026rsquo;the thing that was done\u0026rsquo; back to something they understand or care about. The \u0026lsquo;dollars earned or time saved\u0026rsquo; point above bypasses this entirely. You and your peers may care what a \u0026lsquo;kubernetes\u0026rsquo; is, but normal people don\u0026rsquo;t even know how to pronounce it.\nWhen your bullet-point says \u0026ldquo;I deployed a flibbitygibbit with the shnozwarfle and saved the company $30k/mo every month until the end of time\u0026rdquo;, that\u0026rsquo;s a relatable (and therefor memorable) sentence. Jargon only impresses your fellow nerds, and at this stage your resume is so far away from being parsed by nerd-eyeballs it might as well be on the far side of the moon. Make a connection with the normal human who has to wade through mountains of jargon and nerd-talk, and you\u0026rsquo;ll land interviews.\nThis point is so important, we recommend that if you can\u0026rsquo;t get down to \u0026lsquo;a number\u0026rsquo; (dollars earned, time saved, etc) for a bullet-point, strongly consider removing it from your resume. For numbers you don\u0026rsquo;t know, you can make an in-good-faith guesstimation. You can also reach out to old bosses/coworkers and ask them to help you ballpark a number. You don\u0026rsquo;t have to defend this in a court of law or for a doctoral dissertation. No one is going to leap over the interview table yelling \u0026ldquo;FRAUD! YOU CLAIM SAVINGS OF 10 hours per week per engineer AND IT WAS ONLY 7!!!!\u0026rdquo;\nBusting The Length Myth # The most pernicious needs-to-go \u0026lsquo;rule\u0026rsquo; from the beforetimes is, \u0026lsquo;your resume should never be longer than one or two pages\u0026rsquo;. This may be fine for folks (very) early in their careers, but for those of us who have been in the trenches for some time, abiding forces us to minimize our valuable experience and professional contributions. This field values results, and if it takes you 5-10 pages to communicate otherwise concisely-formatted results, so much the better. \u0026ldquo;All killer, no filler\u0026rdquo; should be the guiding principle.\nThe Rewrite # Here\u0026rsquo;s one potential way to rewrite the sample-resume at the beginning, using the tips outlined here:\nInfra Devops Engineer, YetAnotherCorp, 01/2013 - present YetAnotherCorp proactively coordinates cooperative niche markets to efficiently maximize next-generation growth strategies. Built out the US and EU portions of the YetAnotherCorp offers-portal based on Django, nginx, Redis, and OpenShift. Helped them scale from 30 req/sec to 5000 req/sec over four years. * Built a message queue and processor to reduce load on the main monolith web application, increasing throughput from 30 req/sec to 400 req/sec * Deployed Datadog into Amazon EC2 and RDS for observability and monitoring of the environment, reducing MTTR from 3 hours per incident to 45 minutes per. * Assisted in making a prod-grade Kubernetes cluster from the ground up for corporate services. Standardizing our deploy methodology in this way reduced deploy-times from 45 minutes each, to 15, and encouraged developers to increase our deployment cadence from 3x/week to 4x/day. * Developed and deployed an EMR-focused CI/CD pipeline so the Data Science team didn\u0026#39;t have to spend 20 hrs/wk manually ingesting terabytes of JSON into our data-lake Software Engineer, SomeOtherCorp, 10/2009 - 01/2013 SomeOtherCorp builds real-time voice analysis tools that provide actionable insights from customer conversations. Their platform is based on Ubuntu, Kubernetes, and Java, hosted on AWS. As an early hire, I introduced many aspects of DevOps process and culture to the development team, resulting in increased feature-development, environmental stability, and faster resolution of problems, all while increasing morale. * Full-stack Django dev writing front- and backend-focused features that increased our MAU from 500/mo to 900/mo, and increased our paid-user conversion pipeline 30% * Analyzed, proposed, and migrated various 3rd-party services (DNS, monitoring, Git, package, and credentials hosting, etc) to reliable, redundant, locally-hosted solutions for a $1100/mo OpEx savings. * Made recommendations on migrating self-hosted Elasticsearch to a hosted third-party system, saving $1000s/mo in VM costs and hours/mo in developer/systems upkeep. Sys Admin and Network Engineer, SomeCorp, 01/2007 - 09/2009 SomeCorp specializes in cloud-based email hosting including spam filtering, archiving, compliance, and continuity services. My responsibilities involved managing a small team of four engineers, and caring for a physical server footprint of 200 machines across a dozen colocation facilities. * Led our L1 Service Provider PCI DSS compliance audit and remediation projects, qualifying us for VC funding in the mid-tens of millions of dollars when we gained PCI/DSS certification in Q4 2008. * Optimized pre-existing Jenkins jobs for end-to-end CI/CD coverage, decreasing time to production from 90 minutes per, to 5 minutes per. * Deployed Puppet configuration management for consistent host/network/ACL configuration across all environments, reducing human-error outages from 4x/week to 3/year Core Competencies OS/Virtualization: Openstack, KVM, QEMU, ESXi, Gentoo, CentOS, Ubuntu, Debian, CoreOS, Alpine Linux, Virtualbox, Xen Containerization: Openshift, Kubernetes (CNI/CSI/CRI), Docker/Kolla/Swarm Networking: Cisco UCS/SAN/VoIP, Cilium, IPTables, GNS3, OVS Bridging, iSCSI, FCoE, PXE, Databases: Postgres, MySQL, InfluxDB, HBASE, Couchbase, MonogoDB Enterprise Tech: Buildah, Jenkins, Nexus, Artifactory, nginx, snmp, nfs, LAMP Programming: SQL, C, Java, PHP, Python, Bash, TCL, Perl, MATLAB, REST, SOAP/XML, Git, SVN, BZR, Trac Final Thoughts # In crafting an impactful engineering resume, the goal is not to blithely list past projects and employers, but to craft a compelling story that bridges technology and human interest. A narrative approach such as this transforms a resume from a mere business formality into a conversation starter, emphasizing not just what you\u0026rsquo;ve done, but how your contributions have measurably advanced your past employers\u0026rsquo; missions and bottom lines. By focusing on tangible outcomes — dollars earned, time saved, efficiencies gained - you make your expertise relatable at a level far greater than buzzword-driven development and nifty-nerd-cred projects.\nDone well, a resume is an opportunity to showcase your unique blend of technical skills and professional impact. By following the strategies outlined above, you\u0026rsquo;re not just submitting a bland list of roles; you\u0026rsquo;re creating interest around how you can contribute to the success of your next team, making your application memorable in a sea of jargon-laden documents.\nMake it easy for the humans at the far end of the hiring pipeline to imagine the tangible benefits you can bring to their work, ensuring it speaks not only to the AI gatekeepers but also to the people on the other side of the pipeline who are looking for someone exactly like you, and watch those interviews stack up.\nWant it \u0026lsquo;done for you\u0026rsquo;?
